# Vuex ORM Next Examples

The example application to demonstrate the use case of the [Vuex ORM Next](https://next.vuex-orm.org). It's a simple ToDo application which can add assignee to each todo. You can see how Vuex ORM Next connects those two models – Todo and Assignee – and how to create, edit and delete them.
